> 4th Conference on Computational Algebra, Computational Number Theory and Applications

4th to 6th July 2023

We are very happy to announce the 4th Conference on Computational Algebra, Computational Number Theory and Applications (CACNA 2023) will be held at the University of Kashan, on July 4 - 6, 2023.

The first, second and third conferences of this series were held at the University of Kashan during the years 2013 (26 to 28 December), 2014 (21 to 23 October) and 2017 (21 to 23 December), and this is the fourth conference of this series. This conference covers all topics of computational algebra, computational number theory and their applications. All lectures of this conference will be in-person and some of these virtual and those who are interested are invited to send their articles for presenting on this conference.

## Objectives of the conference

Computational Algebra (CA) and Computational Number Theory (CNT) are two important parts of mathematical sciences. Due to the importance of these parts of mathematics and their applications in science, the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences of the University of Kashan organized a series of conferences on these topics in recent years. CA and CNT have many applications in physics, chemistry, biology, coding theory, cryptography, complex networks, electronics, and computer science. These applications require the researchers to better understand the works and current developments in CA and CNT. The purpose of this conference is to exchange research findings between CA and CNT and related fields, and it can be a good opportunity to familiarize students with new research topics in this field. The 4th conference on this series will be scientifically supported by the Iranian Mathematical Society and the University of Kufa.

The main topics of this conference are as follows:
- Computational Group Theory
- Computational Commutative Algebra
- Computational Ring Theory
- Computational Number Theory
- Code and Cryptography
- Algebraic Machine Learning
- Complex Networks
- Theory of Computing
- Computational Linear Algebra
- Computational Algebraic Combinatorics
